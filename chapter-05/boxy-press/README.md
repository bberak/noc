## Setting Up Dependencies

- Go to the basic-ces project (root of this repo) and run 'lein install'. This will create a .jar file and store it in your local repository (mine is located at ~/.m2)
- Come back to the location of this readme
- Create a folder called "checkouts"
- Inside checkouts, create a symlink to the basic-ces project.
- Now you can go to the root of this project and start 'lein run'
