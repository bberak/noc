## Setting Up Dependencies

- Create a 'checkouts' folder in the directory where this readme is located
- Inside checkouts, create a symlink to '../../basic-particles'. Call it whatever you want
- Go to the basic-particles project (a sibling to this project) and run 'lein install'. This will create a .jar file and store it in your local repository (mine is located at ~/.m2)
- Now you can go to the root of this project and start 'lein run'
